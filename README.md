This repository contains code and pdf output for project 2 of Practical Data Analysis, Fall 2023, Biostatistics Department, Brown University.
Instructor: Alice Paul; Author: Yu Yan

1. Objective: Develop regression models to predict tracheostomy placement or patient mortality in severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (sBPD) cases.
Data Source: BPD Collaborative Registry, including demographic, diagnostic, and respiratory parameters.

2. Methodology:
   * Data assessment for quality and completeness.
   * Exploratory data analysis with transformations, variable selection, and outlier detection.
   * Construction of regression models.

3. Models Presented: Lasso and Best Subset regression models.

4. Performance: Both models show strong performance in various metrics.

5. Limitations & Future Directions:
  * Explore additional machine learning methods (e.g., RandomForest).
  * Consider multilevel mixed-effect models for center-related effects.
  * Address the challenge of missing 44-week data.
  * Evaluate model sparsity vs. predictive power trade-offs for practical clinical use.
